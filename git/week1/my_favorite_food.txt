In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. 
Dip top and sides of biscuits in butter, then in cinnamon-sugar.
Place on ungreased baking sheets. 
With the end of a wooden spoon handle, make a deep indentation in the center of each biscuit; 
fill with 1 teaspoon preserves.
Bake at 375Â° for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. 
Cool for 15 minutes before serving (preserves will be hot).
